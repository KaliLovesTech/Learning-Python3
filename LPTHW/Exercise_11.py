# This Python program demonstrates how to get user input.
# The 'input' function is used to read a line from input and return it as a string.

# Asking for age and storing the user input in the 'age' variable
print("How old are you?", end=' ')
age = input()

# Asking for height and storing the user input in the 'height' variable
print("How tall are you?", end=' ')
height = input()
print("How old are you?", end=' ')
age = input()
print("How tall are you?", end=' ')
height = input()
print("How much do you weigh?", end=' ')
weight = input()

print(f"So, you're {age} old, {height} tall and {weight} heavy.")
