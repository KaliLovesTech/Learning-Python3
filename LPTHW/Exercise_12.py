# This Python program demonstrates another way to get user input.
# You can include the prompt string as an argument to the 'input' function.

# Asking for age, height, and weight and storing the user input in respective variables
age = input("How old are you? ")
height = input("How tall are you? ")
weight = input("How much do you weigh? ")
age = input("How old are you? ")
height = input("How tall are you? ")
weight = input("How much do you weigh? ")

print(f"So, you're {age} old, {height} tall and {weight} heavy.")
