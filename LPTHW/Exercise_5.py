# This Python program demonstrates the use of variables to store personal information.
# Variables are named locations that store different types of data, like numbers and strings.

# Storing name as a string
my_name = 'Zed A. Shaw'

# Storing age as an integer
my_age = 35  # not a lie

# Storing height in inches as an integer
my_height = 74  # inches

# Storing weight in pounds as an integer
my_weight = 180  # lbs

# Storing eye and hair color as strings
my_eyes = 'Blue'
my_hair = 'Brown'
my_name = 'Zed A. Shaw'
my_age = 35 # not a lie
my_height = 74 # inches
my_weight = 180 # lbs
my_eyes = 'Blue'
my_teeth = 'White'
my_hair = 'Brown'

print(f"Let's talk about {my_name}.")
print(f"He's {my_height} inches tall.")
print(f"He's {my_weight} pounds heavy.")
print("Actually that's not too heavy.")
print(f"He's got {my_eyes} eyes and {my_hair} hair.")
print(f"His teeth are usually {my_teeth} depending on the coffee.")

# this line is tricky, try to get it exactly right
total = my_age + my_height + my_weight
print(f"If I add {my_age}, {my_height}, and {my_weight} I get {total}.")
