# This Python program demonstrates basic arithmetic operations and comparisons.

# The 'print' function is used to display text and calculations to the console.

# Counting chickens
print("I will now count my chickens:")

# Calculating the number of Hens
print("Hens", 25 + 30 / 6)

# Calculating the number of Roosters
print("Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4)

# Counting eggs
print("Now I will count the eggs:")

# Performing a complex arithmetic calculation
print(3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6)

# Asking a question
print("Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?")

# Checking if the expression 3 + 2 < 5 - 7 is True or False
print(3 + 2 < 5 - 7)

# Performing and printing simple arithmetic operations
print("What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2)
print("What is 5 - 7?", 5 - 7)

# Making a conclusion
print("Oh, that's why it's False.")

# Asking more questions
print("How about some more.")

# Checking and printing comparisons
print("Is it greater?", 5 > -2)
print("Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2)
print("Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2)
